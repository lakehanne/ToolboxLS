Congratulations on downloading your very own version of the Toolbox of
Level Set Methods.  If you can read this, you have successfully
unpacked the tarball or zipfile and have all of the routines ready to
access.

To use this toolbox, you will need to run the basic version of Matlab.
Tests have been performed on versions 6.5, 7.0.1 and 7.2.0 (R2006a),
but earlier versions 6.* may work.  No additional toolboxes are
required.

To try out your distribution, go into the Examples subdirectory.
There you will find a file:

		addPathToKernel.m  

Open that file with your favorite text editor and modify the path name
contained there so that it contains the absolute path (starting from
root) of the Kernel subdirectory of this distribution.  Save the
modified file.

Then start Matlab, change to the Examples/Basic directory, and try
running:

	convectionDemo.m

If it generates a figure showing a circle moving to the right, you are
on your way.  See the documentation toolboxLS.pdf for more details.
